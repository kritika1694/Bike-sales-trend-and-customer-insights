- Sales Overview by Date :

  Peaks and troughs suggest seasonal trends, where bike sales are higher during spring and summer, but shows fluctuations. Whereas the winter sales are less but more steady. The graph shows an
  overall upward trend in sales, suggesting growth over time. Identifying these trends can help in stock management and promotional planning.

- Sales Breakdown by Customer Demographics:

  Shows age group, such as "Adults (35-64)" or "Young Adults (18-34)", contributes most to the sales. There is a noticeable difference in sales between genders, with one gender(Males) possibly leading in sales. 
  Also a filter of years is given showing the year-on-year sale for both genders.

- Geographical Sales Analysis:

  United States(33%) followed by Australia(25%) dominate sales with more than half of the market share, indicating a potential market focus or a need for expansion strategies in underperforming regions. This can 
  help in identifying where to allocate marketing resources or where to introduce region-specific strategies to boost sales.

  Bikes(Mountain, road and touring) are the top-selling category, followed by accessories or clothing. This insight helps in inventory management and forecasting demand for specific product categories.
